# Capability-Based Coordination Framework

**Technical Repository Supporting: "Capability-Based Coordination and the Bootstrap Resolution of Normative Authority"**

## Overview

This repository contains the complete technical implementation of the Capability-Based Coordination Framework, supporting the academic paper "Capability-Based Coordination and the Bootstrap Resolution of Normative Authority" (under review at Synthese).

## Core Framework Principles

### 1. Bootstrap Resolution of Normative Authority
Normative requirements emerge from the performative necessities of temporal agency itself. Any agent capable of asking "why should I be ethical?" already demonstrates commitment to the temporal coherence requirements that ground ethical coordination.

### 2. Capability-Based Coordination
Agents coordinate through functional equivalence rather than content agreement. Different beliefs, values, and cognitive architectures can achieve coordination through equivalent capabilities for temporal coherence and responsive interaction.

### 3. Universal Coordination Principles
- **Capability-Based Propositions:** Specify abilities rather than content
- **Temporal Coherence Functions:** Mathematical measures ensuring organizational integrity
- **Cross-Scale Markup Organization:** Hierarchical information architecture

## Mathematical Foundations

### Adaptive Temporal Coherence Function (ATCF)
